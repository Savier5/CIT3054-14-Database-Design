# CIT3054-14-Database-Design
All the work done at my Database Design class during my time at PLNU. I have learned in-depth, hands-on introduction to designing and implementing databases that use
relational technologies with a significant market presence. The assignments completed gave me hands-on assignments using an industry standard DBMS, such as MS SQL,
MySQL, or Oracle Server. I have worked with SQL and various vendor extensions to the language. In addition, some advanced topics such as stored procedures and
triggers.
